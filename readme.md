# Mauna Loa Time Machine

* Retrieves images from summit camera and creates a timelapse
* Yeah... that's it

## To Do
- [] Create DB for easier sorting when we have more images
- [] Get it running on Heroku and saving on AWS
- [] Create filtering function for date range
- [] Gulp and SCSS/JS setup

## Notes
* Cron should be set for every 15 minutes since that's how often the feed is updated
